# Veo Videos Generation API Integration Instructions

This article will introduce the integration instructions for the Veo Videos Generation API, which can generate official Veo videos by inputting custom parameters.

Next, we will introduce the integration instructions for the Veo Videos Generation API.

## Application Process

To use the API, you need to first apply for the corresponding service on the [Veo Videos Generation API](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/63e01dc3-eb21-499e-8049-3025c460058f) page. After entering the page, click the "Acquire" button, as shown in the image:

If you are not logged in or registered, you will be automatically redirected to the login page inviting you to register and log in. After logging in or registering, you will be automatically returned to the current page.

When applying for the first time, there will be a free quota available for you to use the API for free.

## Basic Usage

First, understand the basic usage method, which involves inputting the prompt `prompt`, the action `action`, the array of reference images for the first and last frames `image_urls`, and the model `model` to obtain the processed result. You first need to simply pass a field `action` with the value `text2video`, which mainly includes three actions: text to video (`text2video`), image to video (`image2video`), and get 1080p video (`get_1080p`). Then, we also need to input the model `model`, which currently mainly includes `veo2`, `veo2-fast`, `veo3`, and `veo3-fast`, as detailed below:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/vv5pe8.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

Here we can see that we have set the Request Headers, including:

- `accept`: the format of the response result you want to receive, filled in as `application/json`, which means JSON format.
- `authorization`: the key to call the API, which can be selected directly after applying.

Additionally, the Request Body is set, including:

- `model`: the model for generating the video, mainly including `veo2`, `veo2-fast`, `veo3`, and `veo3-fast`.
- `action`: the action for this video generation task, mainly including three actions: text to video (`text2video`), image to video (`image2video`), and get 1080p video (`get_1080p`).
- `image_urls`: when selecting the image to video action `image2video`, the links to the reference images for the first and last frames must be uploaded.
- `prompt`: the prompt.
- `callback_url`: the URL for the callback result.

After selection, you can see that the corresponding code is also generated on the right side, as shown in the image:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/pmwh4y.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

Click the "Try" button to test, as shown in the above image, and we get the following result:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "dd01fc69-e1f7-4b68-aa8c-463f6b748d11",
  "trace_id": "9906dac0-1516-41dc-9fe3-067ca1ba8269",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "253eedc47f1c4eb2a370ed2312168f4b",
      "video_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/veo/dd01fc69-e1f7-4b68-aa8c-463f6b748d11.mp4",
      "created_at": "2025-07-25 16:07:43",
      "complete_at": "2025-07-25 16:10:28",
      "state": "succeeded"
    }
  ]
}
```

The returned result contains multiple fields, described as follows:

- `success`: the status of the video generation task at this time.
- `task_id`: the ID of the video generation task at this time.
- `data`: the result of the video generation task at this time.
  - `id`: the video ID of the video generation task at this time.
  - `video_url`: the video link of the video generation task at this time.
  - `created_at`: the creation time of the video generation task at this time.
  - `complete_at`: the completion time of the video generation task at this time.
  - `state`: the status of the video generation task at this time.

We can see that we have obtained satisfactory video information, and we only need to access the generated Veo video using the video link address in `data`.

Additionally, if you want to generate the corresponding integration code, you can directly copy the generated code, for example, the CURL code is as follows:

```shell
curl -X POST 'https://api.acedata.cloud/veo/videos' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {token}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "action": "text2video",
  "model": "veo2",
  "prompt": "White ceramic coffee mug on glossy marble countertop with morning window light. Camera slowly rotates 360 degrees around the mug, pausing briefly at the handle."
}'
```

## Image to Video Function

If you want to generate a video based on the first and last frame images, you can set the parameter `action` to `image2video` and input the array of first and last frame image links `image_urls`.

Next, you must fill in the prompt for the next step to customize the generated video, specifying the following content:

- `model`: the model for generating the video, mainly including `veo2`, `veo2-fast`, `veo3`, and `veo3-fast`.
- `image_urls`: when selecting the image to video action `image2video`, the links to the reference images for the first and last frames must be uploaded.
- `prompt`: the prompt.

An example of the filled input is as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/8wvlqd.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

After filling in, the code is automatically generated as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/tgzfxi.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

The corresponding Python code:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.acedata.cloud/veo/videos"

headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer {token}",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "action": "image2video",
    "model": "veo2",
    "prompt": "Let it dance",
    "image_urls": ["https://cdn.acedata.cloud/7p1jhy.png"]
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

Clicking run, you can find that you will get a result, as follows:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "98e309f3-35bc-438d-8cb3-4015fc864b87",
  "trace_id": "8bc68066-36de-41ef-ae5e-b7d61ff6aee8",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "59f12222b1fa4fbe9331ff2400ad1583",
      "video_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/veo/98e309f3-35bc-438d-8cb3-4015fc864b87.mp4",
      "created_at": "2025-07-25 16:13:07",
      "complete_at": "2025-07-25 16:16:12",
      "state": "succeeded"
    }
  ]
}
```

It can be seen that the result content is consistent with the previous text, thus achieving the image to video function.

## Image to Video Function

If you want to get 1080p for an already generated Veo video, you can set the parameter `action` to `get_1080p` and input the ID of the video for which you need to obtain 1080p. The video ID can be obtained based on the basic usage, as shown in the image below:
<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/hacabc.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

At this point, you can see that the video ID is:

```json
"id": "59f12222b1fa4fbe9331ff2400ad1583"
```

> Note that the `video_id` in this video is the ID of the generated video. If you do not know how to generate a video, you can refer to the basic usage mentioned above to generate a video.

Next, we must fill in the prompt words needed for the next step to customize the generated video, specifying the following content:

- `model`: The model for generating the video, mainly `veo2`, `veo2-fast`, `veo3`, and `veo3-fast`.
- `video_id`: The reference video ID used to obtain the 1080p video.

An example of the filled form is as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/k56fhn.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

After filling it out, the code is automatically generated as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/8gn4cr.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

Clicking run, you can find that a result is obtained, as follows:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "47a51cfe-2e24-4aba-93b3-546c2dc52984",
  "trace_id": "a8922eec-6f50-4f77-8104-00ded071d59d",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "59f12222b1fa4fbe9331ff2400ad1583",
      "video_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/veo/47a51cfe-2e24-4aba-93b3-546c2dc52984.mp4",
      "created_at": "2025-07-25 16:13:07",
      "complete_at": "2025-07-25 16:16:12",
      "state": "succeeded"
    }
  ]
}
```

It can be seen that the result content is consistent with the above, thus achieving the function of obtaining the 1080p video.

## Asynchronous Callback

Since the time taken by the Veo Videos Generation API is relatively long, approximately 1-2 minutes, if the API does not respond for a long time, the HTTP request will keep the connection open, leading to additional system resource consumption. Therefore, this API also provides support for asynchronous callbacks.

The overall process is: when the client initiates a request, an additional `callback_url` field is specified. After the client initiates the API request, the API will immediately return a result containing a `task_id` field, representing the current task ID. When the task is completed, the result of the generated video will be sent to the client-specified `callback_url` in the form of a POST JSON, which also includes the `task_id` field, allowing the task result to be associated by ID.

Letâ€™s understand how to operate specifically through an example.

First, the Webhook callback is a service that can receive HTTP requests, and developers should replace it with the URL of their own HTTP server. For convenience in demonstration, we use a public Webhook sample site https://webhook.site/, where you can open the site to get a Webhook URL, as shown in the figure:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/tbcnai.png)

Copy this URL, and it can be used as a Webhook. The sample here is `https://webhook.site/aed5cd28-f8aa-4dca-9480-8ec9b42137dc`.

Next, we can set the `callback_url` field to the above Webhook URL while filling in the corresponding parameters, as shown in the figure:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/rgivs2.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

Clicking run, you can find that an immediate result is obtained, as follows:

```json
{
  "task_id": "1ebe4f2b-59ba-4385-a4ea-0ce8a3fe12ed"
}
```

After a moment, we can observe the result of the generated video at `https://webhook.site/aed5cd28-f8aa-4dca-9480-8ec9b42137dc`, as shown in the figure:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/238i32.png)

The content is as follows:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "1ebe4f2b-59ba-4385-a4ea-0ce8a3fe12ed",
  "trace_id": "d1d53c04-58c5-4c40-bb63-f00188540e56",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "2f43ceed37944b4d836e1a1899dad0a1",
      "video_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/veo/1ebe4f2b-59ba-4385-a4ea-0ce8a3fe12ed.mp4",
      "created_at": "2025-07-25 17:19:20",
      "complete_at": "2025-07-25 17:21:45",
      "state": "succeeded"
    }
  ]
}
```

It can be seen that the result contains a `task_id` field, and the other fields are similar to the above, allowing task association through this field.

## Error Handling

When calling the API, if an error occurs, the API will return the corresponding error code and message. For example:

- `400 token_mismatched`: Bad request, possibly due to missing or invalid parameters.
- `400 api_not_implemented`: Bad request, possibly due to missing or invalid parameters.
- `401 invalid_token`: Unauthorized, invalid or missing authorization token.
- `429 too_many_requests`: Too many requests, you have exceeded the rate limit.
- `500 api_error`: Internal server error, something went wrong on the server.

### Error Response Example

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "api_error",
    "message": "fetch failed"
  },
  "trace_id": "2cf86e86-22a4-46e1-ac2f-032c0f2a4e89"
}
```
